# side-scroller-shoot-em
A simple side scroller shoot’em up game with space ships.

- The space ship can be moved around on the game area, and it can shoot rockets.
- The game’s background moves from right to left, with parallax scrolling (the background is made up of two graphical layers, the farther layer moves slower).
- Every 2 seconds, an enemy space ship arrives from the front. The enemy space ships move randomly.
- If the projectile of the player space ship hits an enemy space ship, the enemy ship blows up and disappears (emitting 10 or more particles, where the particles can be any graphical element).
- If the space ship collides with an enemy object, it blows up (like the enemy space ships), the game indicates that it’s over, then it goes back to the main menu.
